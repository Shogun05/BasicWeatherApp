# BasicWeatherApp
Weather app built using the openWeatherAPI that i made for my first semester project.

# Usage
1. Find the 4.1.0 build of android studio in the [archive](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive), and install it

2. Sync gradle libraries

3. Navigate to Weather.java and set your [API_key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) on line 23

4. Build the project and install

Else you can just download it from releases :p
